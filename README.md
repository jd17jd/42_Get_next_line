# 42_Get_next_line

In this project we have learned to create a function that reades lines given a file descriptor in C and compiling it with a variable buffer size.
In order to make this we have reviewed the concepts of:
- Static variables
- The difference between local & global variables
- Services such as read(), open(), close().

Also, have checked the use of memory allocation and how to free it properly using malloc(), calloc() and free().
